Hi all! My name is Ruben. I am a software developer with a strong interest in data science. This is my personal blog. In these pages I will be writing ideas on Data Science, Machine Learning and programming.

I am currently self-studying Machine Learning, so expect some posts on this subject! Specifically, I would like to share part of my learning process with you all. Hopefully, it will end up being useful for somebody. Any ideas, thoughts and feedback is always welcome!

This blog uses the [Chirpy Jekyll theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). I would like to thank [the author](https://github.com/cotes2020) for his wonderful work.
